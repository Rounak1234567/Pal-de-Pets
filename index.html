                <p>Pets do not make judgments about physical appearance or abilities, and they do not care how big your house is or what you do for a living. They care about the quality of your character and your capacity to love.</p>

                <h2>Looking to Adopt a Pet?</h2>
                <p>Pets are not human but display a lot of human qualities like strong personalities, emotions, preferences, etc. While pets are mere domesticated animals for those who do not possess them, for those few who do they are not just dogs, cats, or birds; they are family.</p>
                <p>Despite the odds favouring owners outliving their pets, pet owners are inclined to keep on getting themselves new pets when the old ones pass away. If one has been the receiver of unconditional love and affection from a pet and has enjoyed a pets undemanding companionship then one is addicted for life.</p>
